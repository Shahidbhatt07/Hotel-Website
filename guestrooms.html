        </center><br>
        <div>
            <p id="typ">Before diving into our list of unique amenities, we want to make sure every hotel has the
                basics covered.
                These amenities used to be a main selling point for hotels, but now they’re par for the course. Simply
                put, when guests stay at a hotel, they expect these items to be readily available and free of charge:
            </p><br>
            <h1 class="paa"> Free WiFi internet access:</h1>
            <p id="typ">Remember the days of hotel WiFi that cost $20 per day? Well, some hotels are still stuck in
                that era. Free WiFi is quickly becoming an amenity just like shampoo: guests expect it, and they don’t
                want to pay for it. For some guests, no free WiFi can be a deal-breaker. Want to go above and beyond?
                Let guests stream their favorite TV through platforms like Netflix via your hotel room TVs.</p><br>
            <h1 class="paa"> Gym or fitness center:</h1>
            <p id="typ">Today’s guest doesn’t want to sacrifice their workout routine on the road, so even if your
                hotel doesn’t have its own fitness center, guests will appreciate discounted rates (or, even better,
                free classes or gym time) at a nearby fitness facility.</p><br>
            <h1 class="paa">Mobile Check-In: </h1>
            <p id="typ"> We hear a lot of buzz about guestroom technology and sustainability within hotel operations,
                but this innovation isn’t only limited to the guestroom. With a tech-forward property management system
                like Hoteltime, you can streamline your check-in process and make your front office more eco-friendly.
                Hoteltime's offers a completely paperless check-in with no registration cards to sign and no printouts.
                Instead, the entire process is handled on a tablet through integrations with check-in kiosk hardware
                providers.
                After the guest is checked in, they can leave comments via online comment cards, and when they’re ready
                to depart, the front desk agent can send their folio via email. In contrast to printing several copies
                of the guest’s bill, Hoteltime's system makes it easy to sign and send folios electronically, which
                saves time and paper.</p><br>
            <h1 class="paa"> VIP Shopping at Local Merchants :</h1>
            <p id="typ">Do guests shop or dine at local restaurants when they stay at your property? If they do,
                they’ll certainly appreciate a little extra discount or some freebies! If you're a luxury hotel with a
                concierge they should already have great relationships and if not, it's time to start building them!
                Create a customized area coupon book to help guests save money and encourage them to eat or shop local.

                This project doesn’t need to be something that you take on by yourself; partner with local businesses to
                create a neighborhood coupon book that includes restaurant offers (like a complimentary dessert), shop
                discounts, a free fitness class, or discounts on tours or activities. It’s a win-win for your hotel,
                your guest, and your local business neighbors.</p><br>
            <h1 class="paa"> Room Amenities: In-Room Tablets: </h1>
            <p id="typ"> Let’s be honest, the in-room information binder is so last millennium. Upgrade your
                guestroom guide to a digital format on a tablet to make it easier for guests and your staff to use.
                Guests can find all of the information they need at the tap of a finger, like room service menus and
                restaurant recommendations, and they can even contact the front desk via instant messenger with some
                guestroom tablet apps.</p><br>
            <h1 class="paa">Enthusiast & Hobbyist Tech: </h1>
            <p id="typ"> For a truly unique hotel experience, you can provide technology that caters to specific
                guest interests. Based on your guest profile, certain amenities might not be relevant, but some could
                lead to guest loyalty for life. For example, cater to guests to love to golf by converting a seldom-used
                meeting room to a golf room with a golf simulator. If your hotel doesn’t have the space to add a full
                fitness center, consider purchasing a few Peloton bikes that can be delivered to guestrooms upon
                request. Though the bikes can be pricey (approximately $2400 each), the cost can be a lot less than the
                expense of building out a full gym. </p><br>
            <h1 class="paa"> Local History at Turndown:</h1>
            <p id="typ">Current trends show that guests want a more local experience when they stay at hotels, and
                what could be more local than some interesting tidbits about the hotel’s or area’s history? Make the
                turndown experience even more special by placing a postcard or trinket with a unique story on the bed
                (perhaps in addition to a little sweet treat) in the evening.</p><br><br>
