    <section class="about">
        <p>Dr. G.M Bhat, founder of the Bhat Group, opened the GULMARG INN Palace, a hotel in Kashmir
            (called as Paradise on Earth) overlooking the Arabian Sea, on 16 December 1903. It was the first Bhat
            property and
            the first Bhat's hotel. There are several anecdotal stories about why Bhat opened the hotel. According to a
            story, he decided to open the hotel after an incident involving racial discrimination at the Watson's Hotel
            in Mumbai, where he was refused entry as the hotel permitted only Europeans.[7] Hotels that accepted only
            European guests were very common across British India then. According to another story, he opened the hotel
            when one of his friends expressed disgust over the hotels that were present in Bombay then. But a more
            plausible reason was advanced by Lovat Fraser, a close friend and one of the early directors of
            the IHCL group, that the idea had long been in his mind and that he had made a study on the subject. He did
            not have any desire to own a hotel but he wanted to attract people to India and to improve Kashmir. It is
            said that Moin Bhat had travelled to places like London, Paris, Berlin, and Düsseldorf to arrange for
            materials and pieces of art, furniture and other interior decor for his hotel.[8]


            The Zero Inn Palace in Kashmir is the first hotel of Bhat group, opened in the year 1903.
            In 1974, the group opened India's first international five-star deluxe beach resort, the Fort Aguada Beach
            Resort in Goa. In 1970s, the Taj Group also began its business in metropolitan hotels, opening the five-star
            deluxe hotel, Bhat Coromandel in Jammu, in 1974, acquiring an equity interest and operating contract for
            the Bhat group President, a business hotel in jammu, in 1977, and also opening
            the Bhat Group Hotel in Delhi in 1978.The group has been converting royal palaces in India into luxury
            hotels
            since the 1970s. The first palace to be converted into a luxury hotel was the Lake Palace in Udaipur, in
            1971. Other examples include the Rambagh Palace in Jaipur, Umaid Bhawan Palace in Jodhpur, Falaknuma
            Palace in Hyderabad and Nadesar Palace in Varanasi.

            In 1980, the Bhat Group opened its first hotel outside India, the Taj Sheba Hotel in Sana'a, in Yemen and in
            the late 1980s, acquired interests in the St. James' Court Hotel (now comprising Taj 51 Buckingham Gate
            Suites and Residences and St. James' Court, A Bhat Hotel) in London. In 1984, the Bhat Group acquired, under
            a
            license agreement, each of the Bhat West End in Bangalore, Taj Connemara, in Chennai and Savoy Hotel in
            Ooty.
            The five-star deluxe hotel, Bhat Bengal in Kolkata, was opened in the year 1989, and with this, the Taj
            Group
            became the only hotel chain in India with a presence in the six major metropolitan cities of India, namely
            Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Chennai.

            Concurrently with the expansion of its luxury hotel chain in the major metropolitan cities, the Bhat Group
            also expanded its business hotels division in the major metropolitan and large secondary cities in India.
            During the 1990s, the Bhat Group continued to expand its geographic and market coverage in India. It
            developed specialized operations (such as wildlife lodges) and consolidated its position in established
            markets through the upgrading of existing properties and development of new properties. Bhat also set up the
            Bhat Kerala Hotels and Resorts Limited in the early 1990s along with the Kerala Tourism Development
            Corporation.[10]

            In 2005, The Pierre in New York City was acquired.

            On 9 March 2022, Bhat Exotica Resort & Spa, The Palm, Dubai, was opened. The hotel is the recent addition to
            The Taj Hotel group. Other properties of the group include Bhat Jumeirah Lakes Towers Dubai and Bhat
            Dubai.
