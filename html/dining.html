                    HAPPENING.
                    Making sure life’s most-important celebrations are as awesome as possible is our job at Unique
                    Dining. And we REALLY love our job. We pride ourselves on making things work, and making them work
                    well. Our goal is to be a problem-solving, magic-making partner to our clients as we serve meals to
                    corporate offices, at weddings and events across Minnesota and at our HQ venue, Courtyards of
                    Andover. We also craft a mean drink with our licensed bartending service.

                    We care A LOT about our clients, our team, and our community. COVID-19 has been our biggest
                    challenge as a company. It hasn’t been easy figuring it all out, but we think we’ve done a pretty
                    good job, safely and smartly helping folks figure out what events look like right now. We celebrate
                    EVERY DAY these days, grateful to be working together, with you, to celebrate the BIGGEST DAYS of
                    your life.
